-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This matlab project help you to create a fire detection application which can be used in two ways:

1- real-time fire-detection from your laptop camera.

2- And fire-detection from video.

This is a detailed [report](https://github.com/VraiHack/real-time-fire-detection/blob/main/Fire-detection-using-MATALB-image-processing.pdf) that explain the steps i followed to achieve the objective.
